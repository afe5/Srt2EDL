1
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,490
Ah! Fuck. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,270
Whoa. You okay there, Richard?

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,800
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,000
Sorry, I can't really throw it any slower.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,410
Give it another cut, Richard.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,310
No, I'm fine. I don't want to.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,640
Maybe someone else wants to. Who's next?

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,650
If someone has to go, I'll go,
but it seems very frightening.

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,680
You sure? You got us for the whole hour.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,080
- Anyone?
- Would it hurt your feelings if no one went?

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,150
Man on P.A.: Ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,420
welcome to the annual
Stern-Taylor fall classic.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,680
I'd like to start by making a toast
to our very special guest tonight,

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,550
Richard Hendricks.

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,650
Richard, after your perfect game

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,320
at TechCrunch Disrupt a few weeks ago,

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,460
we fell in love with you and your tech.

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,920
Look, we know everyone in
the Valley is after you,

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,870
and we know that you're probably
going to go with Peter Gregory,

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,800
but we'd love to have you
come play on our team.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,640
Let Stern-Taylor Capital Fund
in on your Series A financing,

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,680
because together, Richard, we'd be...

23
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,980
a home... run!

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,520
- Oh, right.
- What do you say, Richard?

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,960
I'll... I'll do what I can.

26
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,490
All right.

27
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,030
Have fun, everybody.

28
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:30,330
I don't know, man. It's
starting to feel weird

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,560
letting all these firms suck up to us, even
though we're not gonna take their money.

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,660
Richard, Peter Gregory hasn't
officially given us the term sheet yet.

31
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,730
Yes, but he will tomorrow when he gets back.

32
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,860
If you can't enjoy this many people

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,770
kissing our ass at this level,

34
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,400
then I feel sorry for you.

35
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,570
Would you just relax and
take it in for a second?

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,070
I mean, we are getting our
dicks sucked at the AT&T Park.

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,480
We're standing on the field
of the World Series champions.

38
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,410
- It's totally lost on me.
- Yeah, I don't give a shit, either.

39
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,320
Hey! I'm Nicole Stein.

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,350
I lead the Growth Team at Stern-Taylor.

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,050
- Oh, I'm Dinesh.
- I'm Gilfoyle.

42
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,220
I love it. So what do
you two do at Pied Piper?

43
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,000
- I'm the CTO.
- Ha ha, he's joking. I'm the CTO.

44
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,890
Fuck you, I'm joking.

45
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,390
Okay, how could you be the
Chief Technology Officer?

46
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,700
I get it. You hear the word "chief,"
and you think "Indian Chief."

47
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,030
- but you're the other kind of Indian.
- Okay. One, Fuck you.

48
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,530
I'm Pakistani. And two, how
could you be CTO of anything?

49
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,270
You have to be able to organize, you have to
be able to delegate, and you have to be...
